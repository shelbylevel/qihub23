<h1>Contents of AHRQ SDOH Database</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html">Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)</a> database from AHRQ compiles SDOH-related variables across multiple domains from 87 sources including multiple federal and other data sources. The downloadable files contain a total of 675 variables available by year from 2009 through 2020. Data is available across three geography levels: all 675 variables are available by county level, 319 are available by ZIP code, and 321 variables are available by census tract.</p>
<p>These variables are organized into five main categories containing several topics each: social context (demographics, disability, immigration, living conditions), economic context (employment, income, poverty), education (attainment), physical infrastructure (environment, housing, internet, migration, transportation), and healthcare context (characteristics of facilities, characteristics of providers, distance to provider, health insurance status, health outcomes, health care quality, utilization and costs).</p>

<h2>Ohio Opportunity Index</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://grc.osu.edu/Projects/OhioOpportunityIndex">Ohio Opportunity Index (OOI)</a> compiles over 34 variables measuring neighborhood conditions and opportunities, known to be associated with health and well-being, from a variety of domains into a single index score. This index score represents the degree of opportunity available at the Census tract level across Ohio (higher value means more opportunity) and can be used to assess overall neighborhood conditions, target interventions, and adjust evaluations for neighborhood-level risk. It can also be used to learn what types of factors are driving opportunity in specific Census tracts.</p>
<p>The OOI variables comprise seven key domains:</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>Employment</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Access</li>

<p>Within each domain, several variables that met validity criteria and were available to cover the entire state at a census tract level were identified.</p>
